CarPooling Smart Contract
Description
The CarPooling smart contract facilitates the creation, booking, management, and cancellation of rides within a carpooling system. It is designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain and leverages Solidity for smart contract development.

Features
Create Ride: Drivers can create rides by specifying details such as maximum passengers, ride fare, start time, and trip details.
Book Ride: Passengers can book available rides by paying the specified fare.
Cancel Ride: Rides can be canceled by either the driver or passengers, with appropriate refund mechanisms in place.
Get All Rides: Users can retrieve information about all available rides or rides associated with their address.
Status Update: Passengers can mark rides as completed once the journey is finished.
Installation
To use the CarPooling smart contract, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible network.

Usage
Below are some basic steps to interact with the smart contract:

Create Ride: Call the createRide function with the required parameters to create a new ride.

Book Ride: Passengers can book available rides by calling the bookRide function and sending the required fare.

Cancel Ride: Rides can be canceled by either the driver or passengers using the cancelRide function.

Status Update: Passengers can mark rides as completed using the updateStatus function.

Get Ride Information: Use the provided getter functions (getRide, getUserRides, getAllRides) to retrieve information about rides.

Testing
Unit tests for the CarPooling smart contract can be found in the tests directory. Run the tests using a Solidity testing framework such as Truffle or Hardhat.
